# service-bindery
This is a website I created for a Trade Book Binding Business based out of St. Petersburg, Florida. The owner talked to me about the amount of traffic he was getting from his 1 page wordpress site and wanted to make something a bit more robust. I created this website using HTML, CSS/BootStrap, JavaScript and Jquery. I also helped him set up his e-mail using his domain. This website is hosted on Netlify. I will update it as needed. He was incredibly happy with what I came up with considering the amount of information I had to use. Check it out!
